      <h2>Interface: <br> Projection Console</h2>
      <p>Did you know that you can control a room's lights, shades, and even audio all from the same interface? 
        Almost all classrooms at Brown University have projecting capabilities that is controlled through a projection console. It helps to consolidate 
        all the buttons required in the classroom into one interface. This website's goal is to explore and analyze the structure of the interface.
        We will analyze the projection interface within the context of its possible users.

          This interface aims to simplify the complex
          steps it would take to set up a room for a screen projection by consolidating them into this one interface.
          Although the projector, lights, shades, audio, and screen all have their own set of controls, they can be controlled by this one interface. 
          It is used by many to project their screens, to show presentations, videos, and many more things from their electronic devices! 
          <br>

          The initial page(Figure 1) is for fast and easy operations, with common fuctions in the utility bar to the right.
          <br>
          Then, there is an advanced page that brings you to a series of other pages (Figure 2) to have more custimzation and control over the room.

      <h2>Key Observations:</h2>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p>
          Preface: I observed different users who used the projection console throughout Brown University buildings. I were able to observe professors, teaching assistants, and students to provide a sample that 
          represented a broader range of ages, jobs, and socioeconomic demographics since Brown's population is diverse.
          <ul><li>
                      Most people that worked with the interface, often took pauses and stared at the screen for a bit of time, before continuing with their task. 
          </li>
        <li>          Most users connected to the projector with the HDMI cord and this worked often but when users ran into issues with the cord, users would default to using the AirMedia option. 
        </li>
        <li>          Some people utilized the advanced screen to control the screen, lights, and shades in the room. 
        </li>
        <li>          Most people often seemed to make a confused face at time while interacting with the interface. 
        </li>
          <li>          Many users tapped the screen multiple times if it didn't respond quickly.
        </li></ul>

      <h2>Interview Questions and Responses:</h2>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>How would you describe the process of projecting your screen?</li>
          <ul><li>
            I expected a more automatic process, due to the interface not being self explanatory, 
            which made using the interface complicated as there was not one clear way to do the task.
          </li></ul>

          <li>Could you craft an idea of what you should do next at each step?</li>
          <ul><li>
            It was not clear what should be done next at each step, as I had to make assumptions about the button functionality due to the weird and unclear labeling, which led me to explore the different screens and distracting me from the task.
          </li></ul>
          
          <li>Did you expect things to go the way at each step?</li>
          <ul><li>
            Yes and no; There was no help when things go awry and there were too many options, making controls like video routing to be more confusing, however, I would say that I needed the advanced options as basic was too basic.
          </li></ul>
          
          <li>How did you learn to use the interface? Was there any difficulties in doing so?</li>
          <ul><li>
           The interface was similar to a touch screen interface such as an iPad, and I made assumptions on the functionality of the buttons with their labels, 
           however, the labeling and intructions could have been clearer.
          </li></ul>

          <li>Can you describe your overall experience with this interface?</li>
          <ul><li>
            Overall, it was a frustrating experience as there were many unexpected problems that I ran into, and things did not often work on the first attempt, which led to a feeling that
            the process could be easier and a feeling that it too longer than I expected to do the task.
          </li></ul>
        </ol>

      <h2>Empathy Maps:</h2>
      <p>Based on our observations and interviews, we can utilize that data to create personas and convey them with empathy maps</p>

            Figure 1: Susan Sugandee is a graduate student who just got hired as an HTA for Microeconomics and has a busy schedule. She is trying to set up 
            her computer for her presentation, but the process she is used to doesn't always work and she finds it frustrating and time consuming to learn 
            and use a different method. Professors and teaching assistants often have a busy schedule and teach multiple classes with different set-ups,
            which can lead to issues as the process of using the interface is not straightforward.

            Figure 2: Jorge Minden is a typical undergraduate college student who likes to make the most out of his weekends. He has planned a movie night
             for him and his friends but he has trouble understanding how to AirPlay as the projection interface can be overwhelming and unclear for new users with its numerous screens and buttons.
            Jorge represents your general user who doesn't have much experience 
             with the projector interface and is using it for the first time.

      <h2>Storyboard:</h2>
      <p>To help us better understand our personas and their goals, we can create a storyboard that demonstrates our persona's goals, expectations, and experience using our selected interface.</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p id="story">
          <img class="StoryBoard" src="./assets/StoryBoard4.jpeg" alt="annotated sketch of projector">
        </p>
        <p id="storydesc">
          This storyboard is for Susan Sugandee, who's goal is to be the best HTA that she can be. However, due to her many commitments, she tends to rush through
          her tasks. When she turns on the projection console, she see she has many options to present, and tries the easiest and most familiar option.
          However, this does not work as she expected, which makes her frustrated as this method had worked before. Rather than waste more time, she tries another method. 
          Luckily, there was a bit of guidance on the interface that allowed her to successfully project her computer screen.
          This persona did not want to waste her student's time and wanted to perform her duties correctly. This storyboard reflects 
          how the interface does not always work as expeceted, and can be confusing and cause frustratiion.
